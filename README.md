# OceanicBoundaryLayers.jl

This code provides models that approximate the physics of the surface
boundary layer of the ocean.

## Installation

As simple as

```
git clone https://github.com/glwagner/OceanBoundaryLayerModels.jl.git
```

## Documentation

* [LATEST](https://glwagner.github.io/OceanBoundaryLayerModels.jl/latest)

## Example(s)

Coming soon.


# The Boundary Layer Models

This code aims to provide solvers for as many oceanic boundary layer
models as possible. The models currently on our horizon are

* Price-Weller-Pinkel
* Mellor-Yamada 2.5
* K-Profile-Parameterization

## [Price, Weller and Pinkel][PWP]

`OceanBoundaryLayerModels.PriceWellerPinkel` provides tools for using
[Price, Weller, and Pinkel][PWP]'s model.
