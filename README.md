# The Boundary Layer Models

This code aims to provide solvers for as many oceanic boundary layer
models as possible.
Currently we have solvers for

* the diffusion equation
* the [K-Profile-Parameterization](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/94rg01872)
* [Pacanowski-Philander](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0485(1981)011%3C1443:POVMIN%3E2.0.CO;2)
