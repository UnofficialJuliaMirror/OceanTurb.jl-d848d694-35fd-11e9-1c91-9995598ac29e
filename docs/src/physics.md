# Physics of the oceanic boundary layer

The dynamics of the ocean's boundary layer are dominated by forcing from the
atmosphere. Atmospheric forcing includes momentum forcing by winds, salinity
forcing by evaporation and precipitation, and heat forcing by latent heat
fluxes, sensible heat fluxes, and incoming and outgoing radiation.
