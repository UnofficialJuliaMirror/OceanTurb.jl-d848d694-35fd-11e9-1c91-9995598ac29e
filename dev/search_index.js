    "text": "Models for the oceanic boundary layer are partial differential equations that approximate the effects of internal and surface fluxes, and\nturbulent vertical fluxeson the evolution of temperature, salinity, and momentum in the near-surface ocean.Internal and surface fluxes of heat are due toabsorption of incoming shortwave solar radiation;\ncooling by outgoing longwave radiation;\nlatent and sensible heat exchange with the atmosphere.Surface fluxes of salinity occur due to evaporation and precipitation,  while momentum fluxes are associated with atmospheric winds.Vertical turbulent fluxes are typically associated withgravitational instability and convection, and\nmechanical turbulent mixing associated with currents and wind forcing.OceanMixedLayerModels.jl uses  an implementation of atmospheric and radiative forcings that is shared across all models. The models therefore differ mainly in the way they parameterize convective and mechanical mixing."

    "text": "We use a Cartesian coordinate system in which gravity points downwards,  toward the ground or bottom of the ocean. The vertical coordinate z  thus increases upwards. We locate the surface at z=0. This means that if the boundary layer has depth h, the bottom of the boundary layer is  located at z=-h."

For simplicity, we use a linear equation of state between temperature, salinity, and density,rho(z t) = rho_0 left  \n  alpha left ( T-T_0 right ) + beta left ( S-S_0 right ) right  cwhere typical values for the temperature and salinity expansion coefficients  are alpha = 2 times 10^-4 rK m^3  kg and beta = 1."
